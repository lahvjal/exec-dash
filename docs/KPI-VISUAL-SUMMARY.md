## 🔄 Recent Updates Summary

### Key Changes Applied:
1. **All cycle time calculations** now use **MEDIAN** instead of AVERAGE for more accurate representation
2. **Duplicate filtering** applied to ALL KPIs using `cancellation-reason != 'Duplicate Project (Error)'`
3. **Period filtering** standardized across all KPIs (determined by filter bar selection)
4. **Total Sales** now includes JOIN to `project` table to verify `project-status != 'Cancelled'`
5. **Aveyo Approved** source changed from `timeline` to `customer-sow` table with DISTINCT count
6. **Pull Through Rate** clarified to use same time period as Total Sales for calculation
7. **Jobs ON HOLD** now includes period filtering and duplicate exclusion
8. **Install Complete NO PTO** enhanced with period filter and `install-stage-status = 'Complete'` requirement
9. **Install Scheduled** counts appointments within the period (not just future appointments)
10. **M2/M3 percentages** confirmed as always 80%/20% split of contract price
11. **Financial KPIs** (A/R, Revenue, Install M2 Not Approved) clarified to use `project-data` table for contract prices
12. **Field name corrections**: `packet-date` (not packet-approval), `m2-approved` in `project-data` table
13. **A/R (M2/M3)** now filters by active project statuses only (Active, New Lender, Finance Hold, Pre-Approvals) - excludes Complete, Cancelled, On Hold, Pending Cancel
14. **A/R (M2/M3)** now displays project count alongside total dollar amount for better insight into pipeline
15. **Revenue Received** now displays project count alongside total dollar amount to show how many projects contributed to revenue

### Database Value Analysis:
- **8 unique project statuses** identified: Active (713), Complete (2,474), Cancelled (2,247), On Hold (286), Pending Cancel (191), Finance Hold (124), Pre-Approvals (6), New Lender (4)
- **7 unique install stage statuses** identified: Complete (3,003), Cancelled (2,277), On Hold (499), In Progress (128), Not Ready (123), Revision Complete - Review (27), Revisions (2)
- **3 unique cancellation reasons** identified: Customer Cancelled (752), Duplicate Project (Error) (161), Missing Required Docs/Info (29)
- **161 duplicate projects** will be excluded from all KPI calculations

## 🎯 KPI Categories & Data Sources

### 1️⃣ Sales & Approval Pipeline (4 KPIs)

| KPI | Data Source | Calculation Type |
|-----|-------------|------------------|
| **Total Sales** | `timeline.contract-signed` + `project.project-status` | COUNT with JOIN |
| **Total Sales Goal** | Supabase `goals` table | Static value |
| **Aveyo Approved** | `customer-sow.sow-approved-timestamp` | COUNT DISTINCT |
| **Pull Through Rate** | (Active projects ÷ Total Sales) × 100 | Percentage Formula |

**Data Flow**:
```
Total Sales:
  timeline.contract-signed
    JOIN project ON project-id
    WHERE contract-signed IN [period]
      AND project-status != 'Cancelled'
      AND cancellation-reason != 'Duplicate Project (Error)'
    → COUNT

Aveyo Approved:
  customer-sow.sow-approved-timestamp
    WHERE sow-approved-timestamp IN [period]
      AND cancellation-reason != 'Duplicate Project (Error)'
    → COUNT DISTINCT project-id

Pull Through Rate:
  Numerator = COUNT projects WHERE:
    - project-status IN ('Active', 'Complete', 'Pre-Approvals', 'New Lender', 'Finance Hold')
    - contract-signed IN [same period as Total Sales]
    - Exclude 'Duplicate Project (Error)'
  Denominator = Total Sales
  Result = (Numerator / Denominator) × 100
```

---

### 2️⃣ Install Operations (5 KPIs)

| KPI | Data Source | Calculation Type |
|-----|-------------|------------------|
| **Jobs ON HOLD** | `project.project-status` | COUNT by period |
| **Installs Complete** | `timeline.install-complete` + `install-stage-status` | COUNT with filters |
| **Install Goal** | Supabase `goals` table | Static value |
| **Install Complete NO PTO** | `timeline.install-complete` + `pto-received` | COUNT with filters |
| **Install Scheduled** | `timeline.install-appointment` | COUNT by period |

**Data Flow**:
```
Jobs ON HOLD:
  project.project-status = 'On Hold'
    WHERE [filtered by period]
    AND cancellation-reason != 'Duplicate Project (Error)'
    → COUNT

Installs Complete:
  timeline.install-complete
    WHERE install-complete IN [period]
      AND install-stage-status = 'Complete'
      AND cancellation-reason != 'Duplicate Project (Error)'
    → COUNT

Install Complete NO PTO:
  timeline.install-complete
    WHERE install-complete IN [period]
      AND pto-received IS NULL
      AND install-stage-status = 'Complete'
      AND cancellation-reason != 'Duplicate Project (Error)'
    → COUNT

Install Scheduled:
  timeline.install-appointment
    WHERE install-appointment IN [period]
      AND cancellation-reason != 'Duplicate Project (Error)'
    → COUNT appointments in the period
```

---

### 3️⃣ Cycle Times (3 KPIs)

| KPI | Data Source | Calculation Type |
|-----|-------------|------------------|
| **PP → Install Start** | `timeline.packet-date` to `timeline.install-appointment` | MEDIAN DAYS(DATEDIFF) |
| **Install → M2** | `timeline.install-appointment` to `project-data.m2-approved` | MEDIAN DAYS(DATEDIFF) |
| **PP → PTO** | `timeline.packet-date` to `timeline.pto-received` | MEDIAN DAYS(DATEDIFF) |

**Data Flow**:
```
PP → Install Start:
  MEDIAN(DATEDIFF(install-appointment, packet-date))
    WHERE packet-date IS NOT NULL
      AND install-appointment IS NOT NULL
      AND [period determined by filter bar]
      AND cancellation-reason != 'Duplicate Project (Error)'
    → MEDIAN days between packet-date and install-appointment

Install → M2:
  MEDIAN(DATEDIFF(m2-approved, install-appointment))
    JOIN project-data ON project-id
    WHERE install-appointment IS NOT NULL
      AND m2-approved IS NOT NULL (from project-data table)
      AND [period determined by filter bar]
      AND cancellation-reason != 'Duplicate Project (Error)'
    → MEDIAN days between install-appointment and m2-approved

PP → PTO:
  MEDIAN(DATEDIFF(pto-received, packet-date))
    WHERE packet-date IS NOT NULL
      AND pto-received IS NOT NULL
      AND [period determined by filter bar]
      AND cancellation-reason != 'Duplicate Project (Error)'
    → MEDIAN days between packet-date and pto-received
```

**Example Calculation (using MEDIAN)**:
```
Project A: PP on Jan 1 → Install on Feb 15 = 45 days
Project B: PP on Jan 5 → Mar 1  = 55 days
Project C: PP on Jan 10 → Mar 20 = 69 days
Median: 55 days (middle value when sorted: 45, 55, 69)
```

    )

Total A/R = M2 Outstanding + M3 Outstanding
Displayed: Total $ Amount + Number of Projects

✅ ONLY includes active projects (Active, New Lender, Finance Hold, Pre-Approvals)
❌ Excludes Complete, Cancelled, On Hold, Pending Cancel
```

**Data Flow for Revenue Received**:
```
M1 Revenue (20% of contract):

  WHERE (t.`cancellation-reason` IS NULL OR t.`cancellation-reason` != 'Duplicate Project (Error)')
    AND (
      (pd.`m1-received-date` IS NOT NULL AND pd.`m1-received-date` IN [period])
      OR
      (pd.`m2-received-date` IS NOT NULL AND pd.`m2-received-date` IN [period])
    )

Total Revenue = M1 Revenue + M2 Revenue
Displayed: Total $ Amount + Number of Projects

→ SUM of all milestone revenue received in the selected period
```

**Data Flow for Install M2 Not Approved**:
```
SELECT SUM(pd.`contract-price` * 0.8) AS m2_amount
FROM timeline t
JOIN `project-data` pd ON t.`project-dev-id` = pd.`project-dev-id`
WHERE t.`install-complete` IS NOT NULL
  AND pd.`m2-approved` IS NULL
  AND [period determined by filter bar]
  AND t.cancellation-reason != 'Duplicate Project (Error)'
→ SUM of all M2 amounts (80% of contract price) for installs without M2 approval
```

**Example for A/R**:
```
Project #101: $50,000 contract - M2 submitted, not received - Status: Active
  M2 Amount = $50,000 × 0.8 = $40,000 ✓ Include (Active status)

Project #102: $45,000 contract - M3 submitted, not received - Status: Finance Hold
  M3 Amount = $45,000 × 0.2 = $9,000 ✓ Include (Finance Hold status)

Project #103: $60,000 contract - M2 already received
  ✗ Exclude (M2 already received)

Project #104: $55,000 contract - M2 submitted, not received - Status: Complete
  ✗ Exclude (Complete status - not actively pursuing)

Project #105: $48,000 contract - M2 submitted, not received - Status: On Hold
  ✗ Exclude (On Hold status - payment process frozen)

Total A/R Amount: $40,000 + $9,000 = $49,000
Project Count: 2 projects (Projects #101 and #102)

Dashboard Display:
  Primary: $49,000
  Secondary: 2 projects

## 📝 Common Questions

### "Why are some KPIs showing 0?"

**Holdback & DCA**: No data source found in database schema
**Solution**: Need to clarify with stakeholders

### "Why is my sales number different from Podio?"

**Check**:
1. Period definition (Monday-Sunday vs Calendar week)
2. Cancelled projects (excluded from count)
3. NULL contract-signed dates (excluded from count)

### "How do I change the goals?"

**File**: `src/lib/kpi-service.ts`
**Lines**: 95-130
**Object**: `GOALS`

```typescript
const GOALS = {
  total_sales: {
    current_week: 50,  // ← Change this
    mtd: 200,
    ytd: 2400,
  }
}
```

### "Can I see the raw SQL?"

**Yes!** All queries are in `src/lib/kpi-service.ts`

Find the function for your KPI:
- `getTotalSales()` → Lines ~193-225
- `getInstallsComplete()` → Lines ~310-340
- etc.
